## Void

This project uses [Void](https://void.cloud) — a fullstack Vite plugin + deployment platform for Cloudflare. `voidPlugin()` in `vite.config.ts` gives you file-based API routing on Hono (`routes/`), Inertia-inspired server-rendered pages with co-located loaders/actions (`pages/` + `@void/vue` or `@void/react`), auto-provisioned D1/KV/R2 bindings, first-class Drizzle ORM integration (schema in `db/schema.ts` -> `void/db` Drizzle instance -> typed routes -> typed fetch client), built-in auth, queues, cron jobs, edge caching (ISR), and one-command deploys via `vp void deploy`. For first-time setup, prefer `vp dlx void init`; in an empty directory, install `void` first and let the interactive flow scaffold the starter, add the matching framework adapter, configure project files, handle auth, and link or create the deploy project before the first deploy. In an existing app, `void init` configures Void in place by adding missing Vite scripts and creating or patching `vite.config.*` with `voidPlugin()`. Use `void` and `@void/*` package names in source code and package manifests.

Database: define Drizzle tables in `db/schema.ts`, import `db` from `void/db` and tables from `@schema`. Use `void db push` for prototyping, `void db generate` for production migrations. `drizzle-orm` and `drizzle-kit` ship with void (no extra install). Migrations live in `db/migrations/`.

Env: declare every env key in `env.ts` at the project root via `defineEnv({ KEY: string(), ... })` from `void/env`. Read values via `import { env } from "void/env"`. Schema validation runs at dev start (warns) and on `void deploy` (hard error on missing prod secrets). Use `VITE_*` prefix for keys that should be exposed to client code.

CI/editor prep: run `void prepare` to generate `.void/routes.d.ts`, `.void/db.d.ts`, `.void/queues.d.ts`, `.void/env.d.ts`, and `.void/tsconfig.json` without booting Vite. Run it after `vp install` in CI or a fresh clone before typechecking; `vite dev` and `vite build` regenerate these during normal workflows.

Rewrites and redirects: declare static rules in `void.json` under `routing.redirects` / `routing.rewrites` / `routing.fallbacks`, or in a `public/_redirects` file. For dynamic rewrites, call `c.rewrite(path)` in a `defineMiddleware`.

Logs: surface app-level errors that should show up under `void project logs --level error` via `import { logger } from "void/log"` and `logger.error(msg, fields?)` (also `.warn` / `.info`). Anything caught and only persisted to your own DB is invisible to Cloudflare Tail; route it through `logger.*` or `console.*` so the platform can see it.

Full docs are in `node_modules/void/docs/`. If you have the `void` skill available, use it for a complete API reference covering project structure, routing, pages mode, database, auth, typed fetch, KV, storage, queues, cron jobs, CLI, configuration, and deployment.

<!--VITE PLUS START-->

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.
